## Facilitating a workshop

### Preparation before the day

1. Advertise workshop to gauge interest in the day, being clear:
   - What Apache Spark is
   - The session is remote
   - Individuals will be paired up for learning
1. Together with interested parties, organise a day which works well with everybody.
1. Encourage everybody to clear that day for learning.
1. Prep the Wikipedia data so it is available to download.
   `TODO: Provide specific instructions.`
1. Provide instructions to attendees on downloading data ahead of day.
1. Using the seniority as a grouping, identify pairs or triples to work together on the day.

### Actions on the day

#### First thing

1. Open the day informing attendees of who is being grouped up.
1. Tell attendees that we'll be reconvening before lunch for 10 minutes as a full group to chat
   about progress, negotiate with the group what a good time for that will be.
1. Tell attendees that we'll be reconvening at the end of the day for 15 minutes as a full group
   to share feedback, negotiate with the group what a good time for that will be.
1. Be clear to set expectations around how much support you as facilitator can provide,
   and how you can be got ahold of during the day.
1. Be clear that each group should first decide how closely they want to work during across the day.
   As such, groups should also discuss when they'll take lunch, how they'll be taking breaks
   and be aware of other commitments they have.
1. Inform groups that instructions start in [00 Intro to Docker.md](./00%20Intro%20to%20Docker.md)
1. Offer up the space for any questions.

#### Pre-lunch break

1. Ask at least one of the following questions:
   - Does anybody want to share with the group a takeaway from the mornings session?
   - Has anybody learnt something that others might find useful for the afternoon?
   - Who has the best lunch break planned?
1. Remind everybody when we'll reconvene at the end of the day for the 15 minute wrap-up.

#### End of day wrap-up

1. Ask the group if anybody wants to share with the group their thoughts of the day, the format,
   Apache Spark, etc.
1. Announce where additional feedback can be provided in both public, and private channels.
