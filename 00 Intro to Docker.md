# Welcome to Docker

We'll be using Docker as our Apache Spark environment today.

The version of Apache Spark used today is `3.5.0`.

## Format of learning

Each session is composed of:
* suggested ordering number
* a topic
* examples
* practice exercises
* additional reference resources

Each session has been constructed within a notebook.

You are in control of deciding:
* which sessions you will do and in what order
* how much of a session you will complete
* where to deviate from a session

## Starting the environment

1. Download a copy of this repository to your computer
1. Run the command `make` when inside the repository directory
1. Wait for docker to download the image and start the container
1. You should see a link within the console output which looks similar to the one below. Open that link in a browser

   ```console
    http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
   ```
1. On the left-hand side of the browser you should see a list of files. Double click on `01 Intro to Python Notebooks.ipynb` to open the first exercise
